# Android-YouTube-Background-Player

YouTube client for playing music in background. It is also capable of playing music while screen is off.

Application reproduces only audio stream without video, which significantly reduces network load. Stream is chosen adaptively based on network quality.

Player provides mechanisms for searching content, saving it in favorites list, accessing recently played music and loading user playlists by using OAuth2.0. Also, skin can be chosen by using color picker.

These features violate Google YouTube's terms of service and cannot be uploaded to Google Play Store; therefore, I have developed it just for personal purposes as sample project.
